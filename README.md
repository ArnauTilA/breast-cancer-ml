# Breast Cancer Diagnosis ML Project

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Diagnosis ML Project! This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze the Breast Cancer Data Wisconsin dataset. The primary objectives include training robust machine learning models for diagnostic purposes and implementing preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance.

## Key Features

- **Data Handling:** The project efficiently handles missing values and identifies and removes outliers using the Z-score method.
- **Data Exploration:** Visualizations, such as Q-Q plots and Shapiro-Wilk tests, aid in understanding the dataset's distribution and characteristics.
- **Multicollinearity Analysis:** Explore the correlation between features and detect multicollinearity patterns.
- **Feature Selection:** Utilizes Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest for optimal feature selection.
- **Model Training:** Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Gradient Boosting for classification tasks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid Search optimizes the hyperparameters of the models to enhance predictive performance.
